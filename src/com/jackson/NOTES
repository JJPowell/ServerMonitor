TODO:
1. Figure out a way to add a counter so that if a server isn't responding, an email is sent out every hour until it comes back up.
Possible:  If the monitor checks servers once every minute, create a counter that sends an email when it reaches 60, 120, 180, etc.
Add another field to the endpoint class called timeout with setTimeout() and getTimeout()?
